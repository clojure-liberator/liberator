# Handlers

For every http status code there is a handler function defined in
liberator. All have sensible defaults and will return a simple english
error message or an empty response, whatever is appropriate.

Handler key                     | status code | redirect?

## Redirecting

The handlers that are marked as redirecting will set a "Location"
header that is generated from the following mechanism:

### Lookup in context

Liberator uses the lookup key ````:location```` in the context. You
can set this key from a decision function that decides on the
redirection, e.g. ````:post-redirect?````. The value can either be a
constant value or a function that will be called with the current
context.

Example:

{% highlight clojure %}
(defresource postbox
  :allowed-methods [:post]
  :post-redirect? (fn [ctx] {:location "http://example.com/look-here/}))
{% endhighlight %}

You could also use a constant value for :post-redirect like the
[execution model](execution-model.html) for liberator describes.
   
### Lookup in resource

If no location was found in the context, then Liberator will lookup
the key ````:location```` in the resource definition. Note that this
value is used for all redirecting handlers if :location was not set
the context.

Example:

{% highlight clojure %}
(defresource postbox
  :allowed-methods [:post]
  :post-redirect? true 
  :location (fn [ctx] "http://example.com/look-here/"))
{% endhighlight %}
