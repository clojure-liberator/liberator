# List of Decisions

Liberator supports a whole lot of decisions points. Some of them are
needed for next to every resource definition. Others are seldom used
or there is no other sensible implementation.

## Typical decision points for resource implementors

The following decisions points will be typically specified depending
on the desired resource behaviour.

key                         | description                                                                                                                   | default                                           |

## Internal decision points

These decision points are used internally by liberator and provide
reasonable defaults. Overriding is possible, but not useful in general.
