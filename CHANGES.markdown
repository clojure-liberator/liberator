# Changelog

# New in 0.12.3

* Optionally a value can be specified for ring-response
  together with a ring map. This value is coerced to a response
  like liberator does by default while the ring map makes it
  possible to override whatever part of the response.

## Bugs fixed

* #169 Always call as-response, even for default handlers

# New in 0.12.2

## Bugs fixed

* #162 This release actually contains the changes announced for 0.12.1
  Due to whatever reason the revision in clojars did not match 
  what was tagged as 0.12.1 in the git repository.

# New in 0.12.1

## Bugs fixed

* Fix a regression and make default `:handle-exception` rethrow the
  exception. This matches the behaviour before 0.12.0
* Update the decision graph to include new paths after PATCH
  support was added.

# New in 0.12.0

* Support for PATCH method, thanks to Davig Park
* Add `:handle-exception` which is invoked when decision
  functions or handlers throw an exception.

# New in 0.11.1

## Bugs fixed

* #138 context update deeply merges values. Support workaround
  by enabling to evaluate a returned 0-ary function

# New in 0.11.0

* #97 Adds support for a default resource definition map parameter
  that simlpifies the reuse of resource definitions. This also
  adresses #95, however in a different way than it was proposed.
* #100 resources can specify :as-response to plug in custom
  implementations
