# Conditional Requests

A key feature of HTTP is the support for conditional requests. This
allows the user agent to check the freshness of a cached
representation or to prevent update of a resource based on a stale
local representation. Liberator provides the client with the necessary
information and informs the client if the representation was not
modified.

## Last-Modified

To enable the conditional request based on the time of the last
modification, a resource must provide a function at the key
````:last-modified````. The value returned by this function will be
picked up by the default implementation of the decision function
````:modified-since?```` and used to check against the request header
````If-Modified-Since````.

{% highlight clojure %}
(ANY "/timehop" []
       (resource
        :available-media-types ["text/plain"]
        ;; timestamp changes every 10s
        :last-modified (* 10000 (long  (/ (System/currentTimeMillis) 10000)))
        :handle-ok (fn [_] (format "It's now %s" (java.util.Date.)))))
{% endhighlight %}

Curl shows that the the resource sends a 304 if the time stamp in the
request header relates to a fresh representation.

{%highlight bash session %}
$ curl -i http://localhost:3000/timehop
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 25 Apr 2013 07:27:25 GMT
Vary: Accept
Last-Modified: Thu, 25 Apr 2013 07:27:20 GMT
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 38
Server: Jetty(7.6.1.v20120215)

It's now Thu Apr 25 09:27:25 CEST 2013

$ curl -i -H 'If-Modified-Since: Thu, 25 Apr 2013 07:27:20 GMT' http://localhost:3000/timehop
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
Date: Thu, 25 Apr 2013 07:27:28 GMT
Last-Modified: Thu, 25 Apr 2013 07:27:20 GMT
Content-Type: text/plain
Server: Jetty(7.6.1.v20120215)
{% endhighlight %}

Liberator will handle ````If-Unmodified-Since```` as well and supports
conditional updates for PUT and POST.

## ETag

While If-Modified-Since requires that the clocks of client and server
are sufficiently in sync, there is no such need for conditional
requests based on ETags. A resource can generate an ETag by providing
a function at the key ````:etag```` and the required outcome will be
calculated by liberator as expected.

<div class="alert alert-warn">Liberator does not support weak ETags.
The value generated by :etag will be considered a strong ETag.</div>

{% highlight clojure %}
(ANY "/changetag" []
       (resource
        :available-media-types ["text/plain"]
        ;; etag changes every 10s
        :etag (let [i (int (mod (/ (System/currentTimeMillis) 10000) 10))]
                (.substring "abcdefhghijklmnopqrst"  i (+ i 10)))
        :handle-ok (format "It's now %s" (java.util.Date.))))
{% endhighlight %}

Curl shows that the resource works as expected:

{% highlight bash session %}
$ curl -i  http://localhost:3000/changetag
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 25 Apr 2013 07:44:56 GMT
Vary: Accept
ETag: "ijklmnopqr"
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 38
Server: Jetty(7.6.1.v20120215)

It's now Thu Apr 25 09:44:56 CEST 2013

$ curl -i -H'If-None-Match: "ijklmnopqr"' http://localhost:3000/changetag
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 25 Apr 2013 07:45:01 GMT
Vary: Accept
ETag: "abcdefhghi"
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 38
Server: Jetty(7.6.1.v20120215)

It's now Thu Apr 25 09:45:01 CEST 2013

$ curl -i -H'If-Match: "ijklmnopqr"' http://localhost:3000/changetag
HTTP/1.1 412 Precondition Failed
Date: Thu, 25 Apr 2013 07:45:04 GMT
ETag: "abcdefhghi"
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Length: 20
Server: Jetty(7.6.1.v20120215)

Precondition failed.
{% endhighlight %}

Liberator also supports the lesser known sematic of using ````*```` for
````If-Match```` and ````If-None-Match````. These are useful for
conditional updates of resources.
