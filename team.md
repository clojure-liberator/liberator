## Philipp Meier

Liberator was initially created by
[Philipp Meier](http://philipp.meier.name) as a Clojure port of
Erlang's webmachine. Since then it has evolved in it's own ways.

Philipp is a freelance java web developer doing java development
since 1997. He lives in Germany, and is a father of three. 

Whenever there is an interesting project, especially where he can apply
his clojure skills, he is available for hire as a consultant or for
contracting.

## Malcolm Sparks

After creating it's own clojure web library, "plugboard", he joined
forces with Philipp and added a whole lot to liberator. He was the
initial developer of liberator's representation and is a driver behind
the idea of "liberating data".

Malcolm is a java developer and "works in a bank". He speaks regularly
about liberator and is Liberator's most active evangelist.

## All the others

The Liberator team tries to live an open development model, embracing
contribution by others. Currently there are commits by about 10 other
developers. We love how Github makes it dead easy to contribute even
a one liner fix.
